perma damage (decreases when on ship, debuffs do less hard damage/no hard damage) [[MUST BE IMPLEMENTED]] (semi implemented. needs to go away when on ship)
half health on beam down
half healing (could be super brutal idk)
when beaming down, you're reduced to 50% max health
double debuff duration
more money lost on death
slightly increased hunger rate (10% - 15% or so)
(maybe) one shot protection
parry shield (1 health, decent parry window, decently long cooldown) (DONE)
(MAYBE) enemies drop a bomb on death
rare loot pool traders
schmeckels (will do things)
